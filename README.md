# Airbnb Photo Service & Home Page

A front-end design project I did during my time in Hack Reactor. I was responsible for the Airbnb home page and photos microservice.

The photos are from https://unsplash.com/, and are randomized in a set every time the page refreshes.

Please visit the site at https://airbnb-project-clone-allen-bui.netlify.com/ if you'd like to check out the finished product!
